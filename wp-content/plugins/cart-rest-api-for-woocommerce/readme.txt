[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) makes it **easy to decouple your WooCommerce store** via a customizable **REST API** that takes the pain out of developing ‚Äì allowing you to **build fast and flexible headless stores**.

#### Why developers choose (and love) CoCart

The core plugin is free, flexible, and backed by a global community.

## ‚ú® Core Features

CoCart's core features provides everything you need to use with any modern framework you desire.

* **NEW**: Override the price for simple or variable products added to cart.
* **NEW**: Attach customers email address while adding an item to the cart. **Useful for abandoned cart situations.**

* Supports **basic authentication** including the use of email as the username.
* Supports multi-site network.

> An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze. Easy to use, nearly zero setup time. [Harald Schneider](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-8062/)

## ü•™ The API

CoCart is optimized for performance and designed for developers that provides support out-of-the-box experience that manages the cart sessions for both guest and registered customers without the need of being on the same origin as the WordPress installation.

CoCart does not store cookies which allows the developer to cache the session client-side with the use of authentication being optional.

#### üõí Cart API

The cart is the main feature of CoCart that provides the ability to add, update, remove or even restore items individually or in bulk and more.

The flow is simple and returns an updated cart response every time with the totals calculated and stock checks done for you, making it easier to simply update your UX/UI with the results.

#### üõçÔ∏è Products API

Products can be accessed from your store to display how you like by using the queries to help filter by product categories, tags, attributes and much more all without the need to authenticate with WooCommerce REST API Keys.

All the information you need about a product and it‚Äôs conditions to help you with your UX/UI development is all provided ready for you.

#### ‚ûï Extras

Additional API's are provided to help with your user actions as well as debugging.

* Get store information.
* Login the user. (Required if you are using the [JWT Authentication Addon](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-jwt-authentication/))
* Logout the user.
* Empty the cart.

As an added bonus for administrators, CoCart also provides the capabilities to:

* View all carts in session.
* Get details of a cart in session.
* View items in a cart session.
* Delete a cart session.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart‚Äôs core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for ecommerce owners and developers who want to create an ecommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation for CoCart on the [CoCart REST API Docs](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

= Can I change the layout format/add/change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 100+ filters available to do just that. [Checkout the tweaks plugin](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-tweaks) to view or maybe use the examples provided. [View the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) for more.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler in the first place? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that maybe required to help you**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session table in the database? =

The default WooCommerce session table only stores the basics of a cart in session. CoCart provides additional data that maybe required to help you and other add-ons/extensions developed by CoCart or third-parties.

Such as when the cart was created. This information is only stored in the browser session.

Also the source of the cart it was last saved. For the web it will be `WooCommerce` and for your headless ecommerce `CoCart`. This lets you know which version of your store your customers are shopping from should you have both web and app versions.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless ecommerce on another domain? =

Yes of course. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can [manually enable it via the filters in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Can I add "WooCommerce Subscriptions" product to the cart? =

Absolutely you can. Any WooCommerce Subscriptions product can be added to the cart the same way a simple or variable product is added to the cart.

= Why can I not add the same item to the cart with a different price? =

Each item added to the cart is assigned a cart item key which is made of four key values: **Product ID**, **Variation ID**, **Variation attributes** and **Cart item data**.

The price and quantity is not taken into account to make this key.

So if you add the same item to the cart but with a different price, the cart will look up the cart item key to see if it's already added to the cart before deciding to either:
    1. Add it as a new item.
    2. Update the quantity of the previous item, in your case the price.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

Not at this time. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any REST API from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Is CoCart right for my business? =

CoCart‚Äôs REST API makes it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront. It‚Äôs API-first, enabling your business to take the shopping experience to the next level.

Made by and for developers, CoCart immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities.

With our extensive documentation and resources available, CoCart is a plug and play solution that works out of the box.

Save yourself 80% of a headache and hours of development time.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Why CoCart and not WooCommerce Store API? =

Both API‚Äôs are unique for their individual purposes.

WooCommerce's Store API is designed for their [Gutenberg blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts.

It also only works with *Nonces* when you are on the site so for mobile apps or headless ecommerce, you will run into issues. It is also missing a lot of valuable information that developers require to help them.

CoCart's API is designed for decoupling away from WordPress and lets you build headless ecommerce using your favorite technologies. **No Nonces, no cookies.**

CoCart is packed full of powerful features that are completely customizable making it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront how they want.

No matter the type of store you are running, CoCart helps you grow.

It‚Äôs made by and for developers and immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities with it‚Äôs plug and play solution that just works out of the box.

So even if you are new to building a headless ecommerce or already have a WooCommerce store and been wanting to go headless, now is the time to start.

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it via the network and all sites will have CoCart enabled.

= Can I enable white labelling for CoCart? =
